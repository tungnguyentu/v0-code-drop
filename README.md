CodeDrop is a modern code snippet sharing platform with a simple owner-based management system. Create, share, and manage your code snippets using a secure owner code - no account required!

## Features

- **Create Code Snippets**: Easy-to-use interface for creating code snippets
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Support for 20+ programming languages with auto-detection
- **Owner Management**: Simple code-based system for editing and deleting snippets
- **Expiration Settings**: Set snippets to expire after a specified time
- **View Limits**: Limit the number of times a snippet can be viewed
- **Password Protection**: Secure your snippets with password protection
- **Browser Extension**: Create snippets directly from your browser
- **No Registration**: Use the platform without creating an account

## Owner Management System

When you create a snippet, you receive a single owner code:

- **üîë Owner Code** (`OWN-ABC123DEF`): Full access to edit and delete your snippet

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Save this code securely! It is shown only once and cannot be recovered.

## How It Works

1. **Create a Snippet**: Enter your code, select language, set options
2. **Get Your Owner Code**: Receive a unique 12-character code
3. **Share the Link**: Send the snippet URL to others
4. **Manage Later**: Use Edit/Delete buttons and enter your owner code when prompted

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0.0 or later
- pnpm (recommended) or npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codedrop.git
   cd codedrop
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

4. Set up the database:
