## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Extension won't load snippets for editing:**
- Verify the snippet URL/ID is correct
- Ensure your owner code is exactly 16 characters (OWN-ABC123DEF456)
- Check that the snippet hasn't expired

**Can't set view limit:**
- New view limit must be higher than current view count
- Use "Unlimited" if you need to remove restrictions

**API errors:**
- Check your internet connection
- The extension will retry via background script if direct calls fail
- Clear extension data in Chrome settings if persistent issues occur

### Error Messages

- "Invalid owner code" - Check format and try again
- "Snippet not found" - Verify URL/ID or snippet may have expired
- "View limit too low" - Current views exceed the limit you're trying to set

## Privacy

- Extension only communicates with codin.site API
- No tracking or analytics in the extension
